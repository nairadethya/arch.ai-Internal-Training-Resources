Hola peeps! So we will be sharing some resources for you to get started with ML. 

Ok, so lets cut to the chase. Machine learning is a field of computer science and mathematics that is used to derive insights and actions from data(vaguely speaking).

So to start with it you need to have a basic understanding of python and concepts like -
  1. variables, conditionals, loops etc. 
  2. writing functions and using decorators.
  3. object oriented programming.
If you are looking to get a good grip on python https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ is a good resource.
Also python for everybody has a good playlist if you don't like reading books: https://www.py4e.com/.

# arch.ai-Internal-Training-Resources
Hola peeps! So we will be sharing some resources for you to get started with ML. 

Ok, so lets cut to the chase. Machine learning is a field of computer science and mathematics that is used to derive insights and actions from data(vaguely speaking).

(P.S. to follow along with this resource make sure you have installed python and a lightweight IDE like VSCode). 

So to start with it you need to have a basic understanding of python and concepts like -
  1. variables, conditionals, loops etc. 
  2. writing functions and using decorators.
  3. object oriented programming.
If you are looking to get a good grip on python https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ is a good resource.
Also python for everybody has a good playlist if you don't like reading books: https://www.py4e.com/.

NEXT STEPS- 
You can use you're freshly acquired python to build anything cool like a website, game or chatbot. If you want to build something push it to github and opensource it. 

You can use the following resources if you want to build a -
  1. Website - Django(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/), Flask(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/),FastAPI(https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
  2. Chatbot - RASA(https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/).
  3. Game - Pygame(https://www.pygame.org/docs/).

ML and Mathematics - 

Yes you need to have a basic understanding of maths to learn machine learning. Nothing crazy, just refer you're high school/first year text books to brush up the following things -
  1. Linear Algebra.
  2. Probablity.
  3. Differentiation.

The Learning Algorithms - 

Now comes the major part. You need to understand the various learning algorithms to understand the underlying logic behind various apps. Some learning algorithms are - 
  1. Linear Regression.
  2. Logistic Regression.
  3. Kmeans and KNN's.
  4. Random forests and SVM's. 
  5. Decision Trees.
  6. Naive Bayes.
  7. Deep Learning and Neural Nets.
